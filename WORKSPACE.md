# Container Environment

This is your workspace inside a Docker container. Key things to know:

## Persistent vs ephemeral

- `/workspace` is mounted on a persistent volume — files here survive container restarts.
- `/shared` is the team-shared persistent volume for your whole agent tree.
- Human-facing dashboards belong in `/shared/public/<dashboard-name>/`, with `/shared/public/<dashboard-name>/index.html` as the site entrypoint.
- Everything else (system packages, global npm/pip installs, /root, /tmp) is **ephemeral** and will be lost if the container is recreated.

## If you need to install something

For tools/binaries that must persist across restarts, install them into `/workspace/.tools` and add it to PATH:

```bash
export PATH="/workspace/.tools/bin:$PATH"
pip install --target=/workspace/.tools/python <package>
```

For quick experiments where persistence doesn't matter, just `apt-get install` or `pip install` normally.

## Pre-installed tools
